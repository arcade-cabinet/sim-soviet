## A. Advisor Messages

*Voice: Comrade Advisor Yevgeni Moiseevich Krupnik — 63 years old, has survived four general secretaries, two purges, and one ex-wife. Chain-smokes Belomorkanal cigarettes. His left eye twitches when the player does something especially foolish.*

---

**1. Game Start / Welcome**
"Welcome, Comrade General Secretary. You have been elected by unanimous vote of... yourself. This is democracy. Soviet democracy. The best kind, because there is no confusion about outcome. Now please, build something before the people notice they have nothing."

**2. First Building Placed**
"Ah, you have placed a structure. It is... on the ground. This is already better than last Five-Year Plan, where buildings were placed on promises. [YI: Mazel tov] [subtitle: Congratulations] — the bar, it is very low, and still you have cleared it."

**3. Treasury Running Low**
"Comrade, the treasury is becoming... philosophical. It contemplates the nature of zero. Soon it will achieve enlightenment. [YI: Gelt iz keylekhdik — es kumt un es gey] [subtitle: Money is round — it comes and it goes]. In our case, mostly it goes."

**4. Food Shortage — Mild**
"The food situation is not crisis. Is... opportunity for collective dieting. Citizens will become lean. Lean and revolutionary. History does not remember the well-fed, Comrade. History remembers the hungry, because they are the ones who break things."

**5. Food Shortage — Severe**
"[RU: Yob tvoyu mat'!] [subtitle: An extremely impolite reference to one's mother!] Comrade, the people are eating wallpaper paste! This is not a nutrition plan! Build kolkhoz immediately or we will have to explain to Moscow why our citizens are thinner than our excuses!"

**6. Fire Event**
"[RU: Blya, opyat'!] [subtitle: Damn, again!] Fire in sector seven. But consider this — fire is merely rapid oxidation. And what is revolution but rapid social oxidation? So in a way, the building is not burning. It is revolutionizing. ...Please build fire station."

**7. Population Growth**
"More citizens have arrived. They come with hope in their hearts and nothing in their suitcases. This is ideal Soviet citizen — pre-emptively equal. Assign them housing before they start having opinions."

**8. Population Decline**
"People are leaving, Comrade. Not politically — they are still loyal. They are leaving geographically. [YI: Az me muz, ken men] [subtitle: When you must, you can] — and apparently they must. Perhaps build something that gives them reason to stay. Vodka plant is traditional approach."

**9. Happiness Very Low**
"The happiness index has reached level which, in West, they would call 'catastrophic.' Here we call it 'Tuesday.' [YI: Tsuris hot Got bashafn in zaynmol] [subtitle: Troubles, God created in abundance]. Build something recreational. Even gulag has recreational yard."

**10. Happiness High (rare)**
"Comrade... the people are... happy? This is suspicious. When Soviet citizens are happy, it means either vodka ration was doubled or they are planning something. Increase surveillance. Happy people are unpredictable people."

**11. Industrial Pollution**
"The sky over sector three is color which does not exist in nature. Our scientists have named it 'Soviet Mauve.' Is not technically toxic. Is technically... 'aggressively chemical.' [YI: Nisht geshtoygn, nisht gefloygn] [subtitle: It didn't climb and it didn't fly] — but it does hover. Ominously."

**12. Building a Monument**
"A monument! Yes, Comrade. Nothing says 'the people are fed' like a forty-meter bronze statue of a man holding wheat he has never personally touched. The concrete could have been apartments, but apartments do not inspire. They merely shelter. And what is shelter compared to inspiration? ...Do not answer this."

**13. Winter Event**
"Winter has arrived. As is tradition, it has arrived unexpectedly, despite happening every year for all of recorded history. [RU: Yolki-palki!] [subtitle: For pine trees' sake!] Check the heating. If heating fails, the people will burn furniture. If furniture runs out, they will burn opinions. These burn longest."

**14. Diplomatic Event**
"Message from foreign delegation. They wish to 'observe our progress.' This is code for 'laugh at our plumbing.' Show them the new sector. Not the old sector. The old sector has... character. Too much character."

**15. Research Complete**
"Our scientists have made discovery! I will not say what because I do not understand, and they have explained four times with increasing despair on their faces. Something about electrons. Or wheat. Build laboratory and let them do the thing with the equipment."

**16. Advisor Reflects on Career**
"You know, Comrade, I have served under many leaders. Some were wise. Some were bold. Some were wise and bold. They did not last. The ones who last are the ones who are... [YI: a kluger narr] [subtitle: a clever fool]. I say this with respect. Mostly."

**17. Player Idle Too Long**
"Comrade, you have been staring at the city for seven minutes. This is either deep strategic contemplation or you have fallen asleep with eyes open. I have seen both. Either way, the sewage problem in sector two does not resolve itself. I have checked."

**18. Budget Surplus (extremely rare)**
"Comrade... we have surplus. I have checked mathematics three times and had Petrov check also. He wept. In forty years of Soviet planning, this has happened never. [YI: Ven dos mazl kumt, shtel im a shtul] [subtitle: When luck comes, offer it a chair]. Quick — spend before Moscow notices and reallocates to someone else's failure."

**19. Multiple Crises Simultaneous**
"[RU: Pizdets polnyy!] [subtitle: A total catastrophe of the most vulgar variety!] Fire in sector two, famine in sector five, revolt in sector nine, and the vodka plant has exploded, which is both cause and solution to several of these problems. [YI: Ven es regnt brey, iz bay mir keyn shisl] [subtitle: When it rains porridge, I have no bowl]. Where do you wish to begin, Comrade? Choose quickly. Choose wrong. This is the Soviet way."

**20. Late Game — Advisor Is Tired**
"Comrade, I have been your advisor for many years now. My hair has gone. My optimism has gone. My third wife has gone. But the city remains. It is ugly and loud and it smells of diesel and boiled cabbage, and somehow — [YI: kinahora] [subtitle: may no evil eye harm it] — somehow, it works. Or it does not work and we have simply grown accustomed to the not-working. In Soviet Union, this is same thing."

## B. Pravda Headlines

*Voice: The newspaper ticker at the bottom of the screen. Written in the house style of Pravda — absolute certainty about things that are absolutely not true. Every headline is a masterclass in the passive voice and strategic omission.*

## C. Leadership Transition Announcements

*Voice: Formal radio broadcast tone. The announcer is trying very hard to sound solemn while conveying information that makes no sense. Think: funeral crossed with press release crossed with hostage situation.*

---

**1. Standard Transition — Peaceful**
"Citizens of the Soviet, your attention please. Comrade [Name] has assumed leadership of the Central Committee following the voluntary retirement of Comrade [Previous Name]. The retirement was entirely voluntary and occurred at 3 AM while surrounded by members of the security directorate who were there to wish him well. All hail Comrade [Name]. Resume your duties."

**2. Standard Transition — Suspicious**
"By unanimous decision of the Politburo — vote: one for, zero against, eleven absent for reasons — Comrade [Name] is now General Secretary. Previous General Secretary is resting at undisclosed location. He is comfortable. He has books. Do not send letters. Letters will not reach him. This is for his comfort."

**3. Coup — Blatant**
"EMERGENCY BROADCAST: The government has not changed! Comrade [Name] has ALWAYS been General Secretary. If your memory disagrees, your memory is incorrect. Report to nearest Thought Alignment Center for recalibration. Previous leader was [YI: a gonif] [subtitle: a thief] and class traitor. Evidence will be provided retroactively."

**4. Death — Natural (allegedly)**
"With heavy hearts — hearts which are heavy at regulation-mandated weight — we announce that Comrade [Previous Name] has passed. Cause of death: natural causes. The causes were very natural. Mushrooms. Natural mushrooms that naturally appeared in his naturally prepared soup. Comrade [Name] will guide us through this natural time of natural grief."

**5. Succession Crisis**
"We interrupt this broadcast to announce that a new leader has emerged. We further interrupt to announce a different new leader has emerged. We further further interrupt to— [static] — Citizens, the situation is resolved. Comrade [Name] is leader. The other candidates have agreed. Some agreed verbally. Others agreed by being absent. Governing is about consensus."

**6. Reformer Takes Power**
"A new wind blows across the Soviet! Comrade [Name] has assumed leadership with mandate of reform, openness, and restructuring. These are words which mean things and those things will become clear at a later date. For now, rejoice in the newness of the words."

**7. Hardliner Takes Power**
"Order is restored. Comrade [Name] has taken leadership to correct the deviations, errors, and excessive thinking of previous administration. The era of questions is over. The era of answers — specifically one answer, specifically 'yes' — has begun. [RU: Poryadok budet!] [subtitle: There will be order!]"

**8. Populist Takes Power**
"COMRADE [NAME] — CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE, DESPITE THE PEOPLE! In historic election with historic turnout of historic percentages, the Workers' Champion has risen! Bread prices to be reduced! Vodka rations to be increased! How? Details to follow! Eventually!"

**9. Old Guard Returns**
"The Central Committee has determined that progress was proceeding at dangerous velocity. Comrade [Name], age [impossibly high number], has been recalled from retirement to slow things down. Comrade [Name]'s experience spans [number] decades, [number] wars, and [number] other leaders' funerals. Stability is assured. Also, nap time is now national policy."

**10. Military Leader Takes Power**
"[Sound of tanks] Citizens, remain calm. The military vehicles in your streets are there for a parade. The parade is unscheduled. The parade is permanent. Marshal [Name] has assumed temporary emergency powers. The emergency is ongoing. The temporary is indefinite. [RU: Smirno!] [subtitle: Attention!] That is all."

## D. Leader Policy Decrees

*Voice: Each decree is read by the Advisor in a tone ranging from resigned acceptance to barely-concealed horror.*

---

### THE ZEALOT
*A true believer. Has read all three volumes of Das Kapital and memorized the parts he agrees with.*

**Decree 1: "Purification of Ideological Contamination"**
"BY ORDER: All buildings must face east, toward the rising sun of socialism. Buildings currently facing other directions will be rotated. How? This is counter-revolutionary question. The people's engineers will solve this with the people's engineering. Budget: unlimited. Timeline: yesterday."

**Decree 2: "Mandatory Enthusiasm Initiative"**
"Citizens are henceforth required to smile between hours of 0600 and 2200. Smiles will be measured by block wardens using Smile Compliance Calipers (to be manufactured). Frowning is not illegal — it is merely evidence of capitalist infiltration of the facial muscles."

**Decree 3: "Renaming of Days"**
"The bourgeois calendar is abolished. Monday is now 'Laborday.' Tuesday is 'Also Laborday.' Wednesday through Sunday are 'Continued Laborday.' Rest occurs during Annual Rest Minute, scheduled for March."

*[Advisor aside: "[YI: A meshugener blaybt a meshugener] [subtitle: A madman stays a madman]. Comrade, this one — he has the fire. Unfortunately, the fire is in the library."]*

---

### THE IDEALIST
*Genuinely believes in the dream. This makes them the most dangerous kind.*

**Decree 1: "The Sharing Mandate"**
"All personal property is now communal property. Your shoes are the people's shoes. Your coat is the people's coat. Your wife's opinions are the people's opinions. Citizens should feel liberated. If they do not feel liberated, they are holding liberation incorrectly."

**Decree 2: "Art for the Proletariat"**
"Every factory must now contain a poetry corner. Workers shall compose verse during lunch break about the beauty of industrial output. Rhyming is encouraged. Content about sadness, longing, or the color grey is discouraged. Productivity may decrease. The soul will expand. These are acceptable terms."

**Decree 3: "Abolition of Currency (Attempt #4)"**
"Money is a construct of the oppressor class. Effective immediately, all transactions will be conducted through the barter of labor-hours and good intentions. [YI: Az men hot nit keyn moakh, hot men koyekh in di fis] [subtitle: If you don't have brains, you'd better have legs]. Previous three attempts at this are not to be mentioned."

*[Advisor aside: "I do not have heart to tell him that his predecessor tried this. And the one before. And the one before that. The beautiful idea keeps meeting the ugly reality. Reality always wins. But the idea — [YI: nebekh] [subtitle: poor thing] — the idea keeps getting back up."]*

---

### THE REFORMER
*Wants to fix the system from within. Does not realize the system considers this an attack.*

**Decree 1: "Transparency in Governance (Limited)"**
"Henceforth, certain government proceedings will be made available to citizens. Specifically: the minutes from meetings about what color to paint the meeting room. All other proceedings remain classified. This is openness. This is [RU: glasnost'] [subtitle: glasnost/openness]. You are welcome."

**Decree 2: "Economic Liberalization Pilot Program"**
"In sector four — and ONLY sector four — citizens may engage in limited private enterprise. Selling of goods is permitted. Buying of goods is permitted. Profiting from goods is... being studied. If sector four does not catch fire, program will expand. If it catches fire, program was Western sabotage."

**Decree 3: "Criticism Suggestion Box"**
"A box has been placed in the central square where citizens may deposit anonymous suggestions for improvement. The box is monitored by cameras. The cameras are for the box's protection. The suggestions are anonymous. The handwriting analysis is unrelated."

*[Advisor aside: "Comrade Reformer means well. This is his problem. In this system, meaning well is like wearing target. [YI: Der emes iz der bester lign] [subtitle: The truth is the best lie]. He tells truth and calls it reform. We call it evidence."]*

---

### THE TECHNOCRAT
*Believes all problems are engineering problems. Has never met a person.*

**Decree 1: "Optimization of Human Resources"**
"Citizens will henceforth be assigned alphanumeric designators for efficiency. Names are redundant data. Citizen RK-7734 does not need to be 'Ivan' to produce ball bearings. Emotional objections have been noted and filed in the Irrelevant Data Archive."

**Decree 2: "Centralized Meal Algorithm"**
"Diet planning is now automated. All citizens will consume Nutritional Paste C-12 on Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Paste D-7 on Tuesday, Thursday. Saturday: Paste C-12 and D-7 combined (celebration blend). Sunday: fasting (system maintenance). Caloric intake optimized. Joy intake... not in current model."

**Decree 3: "Infrastructure Rationalization Matrix"**
"All buildings will be placed according to the Optimal Placement Grid (OPG). The OPG has been calculated by our finest computers. The computers do not care about 'scenic views' or 'proximity to grandmother.' The computers are correct. Grandmother will adapt."

*[Advisor aside: "[RU: Blin...] [subtitle: Darn...] This one, he sees city as machine. And people as parts of machine. He is not wrong — but machine has no soul, and city without soul is just... geometry. Very efficient geometry. [YI: A kluger farshteit fun ein vort tsvei] [subtitle: A wise man hears one word and understands two]. This one hears one number and understands only number."]*

---

### THE APPARATCHIK
*Has no ideology except survival. Has outlasted everyone by agreeing with everyone.*

**Decree 1: "Continuation of Existing Policy"**
"After careful review, all policies of previous leader — who was a great leader, or a terrible leader, depending on which is currently correct — shall remain in effect. Changes will be made if necessary. Necessity will be determined later. Sincerely, the management."

**Decree 2: "Committee for the Formation of Committees"**
"A new committee has been established to determine which committees are necessary. This committee will report to a sub-committee which reports to the oversight committee which reports to me. Timeline for first finding: one to seven years. Until then, everything continues as before. This is not inaction. This is process."

**Decree 3: "Strategic Ambiguity Doctrine"**
"Official position on [current crisis] is as follows: we are aware. We are concerned. We are addressing. Specifics are forthcoming. Forthcoming means: coming forth. When? Forth. [YI: Vos iz di kashye?] [subtitle: What's the problem?] There is no problem. See? Decree works already."

*[Advisor aside: "This one will survive nuclear winter. Cockroaches will look at him with professional respect. He believes in nothing, and therefore nothing can disappoint him. Is this wisdom? [YI: A nar blaybt a nar] [subtitle: A fool stays a fool]. Or perhaps — and I say this with great tiredness — perhaps he is smartest one of all."]*

---

### THE POPULIST
*Loves the people. Specifically, loves the sound of the people cheering.*

**Decree 1: "Double Vodka Rations for All!"**
"The people have SUFFERED! The people have ENDURED! The people deserve VODKA! Effective immediately, vodka rations are doubled! How will this be funded? By the SPIRIT of the PEOPLE! Also by reducing the education budget. Education makes people ask questions. Vodka makes people sing. Singing is better."

**Decree 2: "Festival of the Worker (Monthly)"**
"Each month, production will halt for three-day Festival of the Worker! There will be music! Dancing! Speeches — so many speeches! Workers will celebrate the dignity of work by not working! [RU: Gulyay, dusha!] [subtitle: Let the soul run wild!] Productivity impact: not important. Morale impact: also not important. What is important: the PEOPLE see their leader CARES."

**Decree 3: "Enemy of the Month Program"**
"Each month, a new enemy will be identified and blamed for all shortages. January: kulaks. February: also kulaks. March: intellectuals. April: weather. May through December: kulaks again. The people need someone to blame. I give them someone. This is love."

*[Advisor aside: "He gives the people bread and circuses. Well — circuses. The bread is... forthcoming. [YI: Mit honik ken men khapn mer fliegen vi mit esik] [subtitle: You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar]. But eventually the honey runs out and the flies notice. They always notice."]*

---

### THE MILITARIST
*Every problem looks like a nail when you have seventeen thousand tanks.*

**Decree 1: "Total Mobilization of Infrastructure"**
"All civilian buildings are hereby redesignated as military installations. Your apartment is now a barracks. Your kitchen is now a field mess. Your toilet is now a... strategic facility. Act accordingly. [RU: Ravnyays'! Smirno!] [subtitle: Dress ranks! Attention!] Civilian life was inefficient. Military life is efficient. You will thank me. After the war."

**Decree 2: "Fortification of All Sectors"**
"Every building shall be surrounded by anti-tank barriers, observation posts, and mandatory camouflage netting. Yes, including the kindergarten. ESPECIALLY the kindergarten. The enemy expects weakness there. We shall give them CONCRETE. Children will adapt. Children are resilient. This is why we train them."

**Decree 3: "Parade Readiness Protocol"**
"All vehicles, personnel, and livestock must be parade-ready at all times. Tanks polished. Boots shined. Goats groomed. The West must see our strength. They must see our goats. Our goats are the finest goats. [RU: Ura!] [subtitle: Hurrah!] Military spending increased by 300%. Specify from which budget? All of them."

*[Advisor aside: "He sees enemies everywhere. Under bed. In soup. Behind curtain. [YI: Az me lebt, derlebt men] [subtitle: If you live long enough, you'll live to see everything]. I have lived long enough to see a man declare war on pigeons. He lost. The pigeons are still there. The man is not. I say nothing further."]*

---

### THE MYSTIC
*Has had a vision. Unfortunately, the vision was mostly fog.*

**Decree 1: "Cosmic Harmony Alignment"**
"The stars have spoken to me, comrades. They say: move the coal plant seventeen meters to the left. Why? The ley lines. What ley lines? THE ley lines. This is not superstition — this is SCIENCE that science has not yet discovered. Previous leader ignored the cosmic vibrations. Look what happened to him."

**Decree 2: "National Day of Contemplation"**
"All citizens will spend Thursday in silent meditation upon the dialectical relationship between worker and cosmos. Factories will operate in 'whisper mode.' What is whisper mode? It is mode where factory whispers. Engineers say this is impossible. Engineers lack spiritual vision. [YI: Got hot bashafn di velt mit verter] [subtitle: God created the world with words]. I create policy with feelings."

**Decree 3: "The Leader's Dream Protocol"**
"Last night I dreamed of a great bear walking through golden wheat. This means we must build three more monuments in sector six. The bear was clear about this. The wheat also. Do not question the dream, comrade. The dream is the purest form of Five-Year Plan — it comes from beyond consciousness, where quotas do not apply and all harvests are bountiful."

*[Advisor aside: "[RU: Mat' moya...] [subtitle: My mother... (expression of dismay)] This one talks to the stars and the stars talk back. [YI: Fun a kats un a nar, ken men zikh nit hitn] [subtitle: Against a cat and a fool, you cannot protect yourself]. At least the Militarist was predictable. With this one, I come to work each morning and check: are we at war with the moon yet? Not yet. But it is Tuesday."]*

---

## E. Citizen Complaints

*Voice: Brief, plaintive, the voice of actual human beings living in this system. Each one is immediately cut off by the state apparatus. The comedy is in what almost gets said.*

**1.** "The bread line is now longer than the road it stands o— **[REDACTED BY ORDER OF MINISTRY OF TRUTH]**"

---

## F. Building Placement Lines

*Voice: The Advisor reacts in real-time as the player places buildings. His reactions range from grudging approval to existential dread.*

---

### COAL PLANT

**1.** "Coal plant. Good. Electricity from the earth's ancient corpses. Is poetic, in way that makes lungs hurt. The smoke will be thick and dark, like the future. But at least the future will be warm."

**2.** "Ah, you place the coal plant upwind of the tenements. Bold. The people will breathe character. Character smells like sulfur, but this is small price for progress."

**3.** "[RU: Nu, poekhali.] [subtitle: Well, here we go.] Another coal plant. The sky was already grey. Now it will be... greyer. There is always another shade of grey, Comrade. This is the lesson of Soviet industry."

---

### TENEMENT

**1.** "You are building tenement, da? Is good. Concrete box for concrete people. They will be... not unhappy. This is highest praise in city where 'not unhappy' is aspiration."

**2.** "Another housing block. Twelve floors, eight hundred souls, one shared dream of slightly larger housing block. The architect has given each unit a window. Some windows face outside. Others face the wall of next building. These citizens will develop rich inner life."

**3.** "Tenement number... I have lost count. [YI: Vos iz der khilek?] [subtitle: What's the difference?] They are all the same. This is not criticism — this is the point. Equality of architecture. Every family gets same grey, same cracks, same view of identical grey across the street."

---

### KOLKHOZ (Collective Farm)

**1.** "Kolkhoz! Food from the ground, by the people, for the people. Historically, the ground has not cooperated. But this time — [YI: im yirtse hashem] [subtitle: God willing] — this time the beets will be larger than the promises."

**2.** "You place farm on soil that looks... tired. Soil is tired, Comrade. It has been collectivized, de-collectivized, re-collectivized. It does not know what it is anymore. Give it time. Give it fertilizer. Give it pep talk if necessary."

**3.** "[RU: Oy, nu ladno.] [subtitle: Oh, well, alright.] Kolkhoz it is. Assign the farmers. Tell them the quota. Do not tell them the quota is impossible. Let them discover this naturally, as generations before them have."

---

### VODKA PLANT

**1.** "Vodka plant! Now you govern like true Soviet leader. The people need many things — food, shelter, warmth, dignity. Vodka is four of these things simultaneously. Is miracle of chemistry."

**2.** "Smart placement, Comrade. Vodka plant between tenement and factory. Worker wakes up, drinks, works, drinks, sleeps. Beautiful efficiency. The circle of Soviet life, lubricated."

**3.** "[YI: L'chaim!] [subtitle: To life!] Vodka plant goes up, complaints go down. Is direct mathematical relationship. Our finest economists have confirmed: one vodka plant neutralizes approximately three systemic failures. Build four, and you can fail at almost anything."

---

### GULAG

**1.** "Ah. Gulag. [long pause] ...Is 'rehabilitation center,' Comrade. For citizens who are... too free. With their thinking. They go in with questions. They come out with answers. Specifically, the answer 'yes.' To everything."

**2.** "You place gulag in sector eight. Neighbors will be... motivated. Productivity in adjacent sectors historically increases by 200%. Also, noise complaints decrease by 100%. Correlation? Who is asking? [YI: Freg nit] [subtitle: Don't ask]."

**3.** "[RU: Nu chto zh...] [subtitle: Well then...] Gulag. Every Soviet city needs one. Like a hospital, but for the soul. And also for the body. The body does much digging. The soul does much... learning. Some citizens graduate. Some transfer to... other facility. We do not discuss other facility."

---

### ROAD

**1.** "Road. Excellent. Connects point A to point B. In capitalist country, people choose where to go. Here, point B has been pre-selected. Road is freedom — freedom to go exactly where you are told, but now faster."

**2.** "You build road through sector three. Good. Previously, citizens walked through mud. Now they will walk next to road through mud, because road is for official vehicles only. But the proximity to road — this is the luxury."

**3.** "Another road to nowhere. But in Soviet city, nowhere is somewhere, because Party has designated it as destination. Congratulations to nowhere. It is now part of the plan."

---

### SCHOOL

**1.** "School! You build school. The children will learn mathematics, which they will use to calculate how long the bread line is. They will learn history, which will change depending on who is leader. They will learn loyalty, which does not change. This is the permanent subject."

**2.** "Ah, education. [YI: Toyre iz di beste skhoyre] [subtitle: Learning is the best merchandise]. Fill the minds of the young with knowledge. Approved knowledge. From approved books. The other books are in the... other place. Build school, Comrade. Educated people are dangerous, but uneducated people are useless. We need the dangerous kind."

---

### HOSPITAL

**1.** "Hospital. Where citizens go to be healed by doctors who are paid in gratitude and potatoes. Equipment is from 1947. Medicine is from wherever we can get it. But the doctors — [YI: khasene gehat] [subtitle: married to their work] — the doctors are genuine. This is the one thing I do not joke about. Build the hospital."

**2.** "You place hospital. Inside there will be beds, bandages, and a portrait of the General Secretary, which cures nothing but is mandatory. The doctors will do their best. 'Their best' is limited by budget. Budget is limited by everything. [RU: Chto delat'?] [subtitle: What is to be done?] Build it anyway."

---

### BARRACKS

**1.** "Barracks. For the soldiers. They will eat here, sleep here, and practice looking serious in case of parade. The actual military threat is... unclear. But the readiness for the unclear threat must be absolute. This is defense policy."

**2.** "Military barracks in sector five. The soldiers will be comforted knowing they defend the city from enemies. Which enemies? [RU: A khren yego znayet.] [subtitle: Who the hell knows.] All of them. None of them. The concept of enemy. Build barracks. Is cheaper than thinking about it."

---

### RADIO STATION

**1.** "Radio station! Now the people can hear the truth. Our truth. The only truth. Broadcast at volume that makes thinking unnecessary. Frequency: always. Content: approved. Static: also approved. Sometimes the static says more. But we do not discuss this."

**2.** "You build radio station. Excellent. Now propaganda reaches INSIDE the tenement. Before, citizens could close door and have thoughts. Private thoughts. Unmonitored thoughts. [YI: Nisht gut] [subtitle: Not good]. Radio solves this. Radio is everywhere. Radio is friend who never leaves and never stops talking. Best kind of friend."

## G. Game Over / Failure States

*Voice: Even in failure, the system persists. The Advisor delivers these with a mixture of dark comedy and genuine philosophical weight. The Soviet Union may fall, but it falls in the most Soviet way possible.*

---

**1. Total Resource Depletion**
"Comrade... we have run out of everything. Coal: gone. Food: gone. Vodka: gone first, actually. The warehouses echo with the footsteps of rats who have also left for better opportunities. [YI: Fun gornisht kumt gornisht] [subtitle: From nothing comes nothing]. But do not despair. In Soviet system, even nothing is something — it is shared nothing. Equally distributed emptiness. The dream lives, Comrade. The dreamers, however, have relocated. ...GAME OVER. The state persists. The state always persists. Only its contents change."

**2. Total Population Loss**
"The last citizen has departed. The city stands empty. Wind blows through tenements where once there was complaining, and I miss the complaining, Comrade. I miss it very much. [RU: Tishina, blyad', takaya, chto ushi zvenyat.] [subtitle: Such silence, damn it, that the ears ring.] A city without people is just... sculpture. Very large, very ugly sculpture. ...THE STATE PERSISTS. It persists for no one, but it persists. This is the most Soviet outcome possible."

**3. Leader Assassinated**
"Comrade General Secretary is dead. The method was... creative. I will spare you details, but it involved a samovar, and things will never be the same with samovars. [YI: Az me lebt, derlebt men alts] [subtitle: If you live long enough, you see everything]. I have lived too long. Another leader will emerge. They always do. Like mushrooms after rain — sudden, unwanted, and sometimes poisonous. ...NEW LEADER SEQUENCE INITIATED. The seat is still warm. Sit."

**4. Revolution / Uprising**
"The people have risen. [RU: Nu, pizdets.] [subtitle: Well, we're thoroughly screwed.] They carry signs. They carry torches. One carries a goat for reasons unclear. They march on the Central Committee building, which is you, Comrade. Which is us. [Long pause] You know, the original revolution was also like this. People with signs. People with torches. It is... how you say... cyclical. [YI: Vi di muter, azoy di tokhter] [subtitle: Like the mother, so the daughter]. The revolution eats its children, and the children grow up to become the next revolution. ...GAME CONTINUES. There is always a next revolution. Place new tenement."

**5. Economic Collapse**
"The economy has achieved a state which our economists describe as 'hypothetical.' As in: it hypothetically exists. The ruble is worth less than the paper it is printed on, which is ironic, because we are also out of paper. [YI: A makhe af kapores] [subtitle: A plague on it all]. But consider: the West says our economy has collapsed. We say our economy has been LIBERATED from the tyranny of functioning. ...THE STATE ADAPTS. Barter system engaged. One potato equals one hour of labor. One hour of labor equals one potato. System is elegant in its hopelessness."

**6. Nuclear Incident**
"There has been a... thermal event. In the reactor. Sector twelve is now a concept rather than a place. The evacuation is underway. The evacuation will continue for approximately ten thousand years. [RU: Yobanyy v rot etot atom...] [subtitle: An extremely vulgar opinion about the atom...] Our scientists said it was safe. Our scientists are now also evacuating. [YI: Der mentsh trakht un got lakht] [subtitle: Man plans and God laughs]. Build the city elsewhere. Twenty kilometers should suffice. Our scientists say. ...But our scientists also said the reactor was safe, so make it thirty."

**7. Ideological Collapse (Happiness at absolute zero, all citizens disillusioned)**
"Comrade... the people have stopped believing. Not in you. Not in the Party. In everything. The propaganda plays and they do not hear it. The speeches echo and they do not listen. They go to work and they do the work but behind their eyes there is... nothing. This is worse than revolt. Revolt has energy. This is... [YI: di greste shtraf iz tsu lebn un nisht visn farvos] [subtitle: the greatest punishment is to live and not know why]. The buildings stand. The factories run. The city functions. But the dream — the great, stupid, beautiful, impossible dream — the dream is dead. ...THE STATE PERSISTS. The state always persists. It simply persists without meaning now. Like most things. ...Place new vodka plant. Is all we can do."

**8. All Buildings Destroyed (Fire/Disaster)**
"[Long silence] ...The city is... flat. All of it. Every sector. Flat. I am standing in what was the Central Committee building and I can see the horizon in every direction, which in this city was previously not possible due to the quantity of concrete. [RU: Mat' tvoyu za nogu...] [subtitle: An anatomically creative oath of despair...] Comrade, we start again. This is not tragedy. This is tradition. Russia has been burned, frozen, invaded, and flattened since the beginning of time, and every time, some [YI: meshuggeneh] [subtitle: crazy person] starts stacking bricks again. You are that meshuggeneh. I am that meshuggeneh. Build. Again. Always again. ...CONSTRUCTION MODE REACTIVATED. You have: nothing. You need: everything. Begin."

**9. Annexation by Foreign Power**
"It appears we have been... absorbed. By the neighbor state. Their tanks are very polite — they wiped their treads before entering. The flag has changed. The anthem has changed. The portraits have changed. I will now serve the new leader, as I served the old leader, as I served the one before. [YI: Unter yedn dakh iz do a vey] [subtitle: Under every roof there is a sorrow]. The sorrow simply changes accent. ...REGIME CHANGE COMPLETE. New management appreciates your effort. New management requests you rebuild in new style. New style is same style with different hat."

**10. Time Simply Runs Out (Entropy ending)**
"Comrade, I must inform you: there is no more time. Not politically — literally. The clock has run out. The Five-Year Plan has become the Final Plan. And what have we built? [Gestures at city] This. All of this. This ugly, wheezing, soot-covered, vodka-soaked, improbable thing. [Long pause] It wasn't good, Comrade. Let us not pretend. But it was ours. [YI: Ale mentshn zenen brider, ober keyn brider zenen nit glaykh] [subtitle: All men are brothers, but no brothers are equal]. We tried to make them equal. We failed. But — [RU: Yolki-palki] [subtitle: for pine trees' sake] — did we try. ...FINAL SCORE CALCULATED. Rating: Soviet. This is neither compliment nor insult. It simply is."
