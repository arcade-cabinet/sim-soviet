These were written earlier and contain deep reference material:

- `design-era-doctrines.md` — 8 doctrine definitions with modifiers, policies, signature mechanics
- `design-leader-archetypes.md` — 8 leader archetypes with behavioral loops
- `design-leadership-architecture.md` — ECS components, modifier pipeline
- `design-power-transitions.md` — Succession mechanics, coup/purge/death systems
- `design-dialog-bible.md` — Advisor dialog, event text
- `reference-politburo-system.md` — Existing PolitburoSystem documentation
- `reference-pravda-system.md` — Headline generation system
- `reference-world-building.md` — Timeline events, achievements

### Design Principles

1. **Historical authenticity first** — Research how the real Soviet system worked, then gamify it
2. **The system is the enemy** — No external threats, only the apparatus
3. **Comfortable mediocrity** — The optimal strategy is being unremarkable
4. **Top-down pressure** — The player never chooses what to build, only how to survive mandates
5. **Mobile-first** — Every interaction designed for phone screens
