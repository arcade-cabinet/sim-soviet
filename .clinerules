# Agentic Memory Bank

This project uses an agentic memory bank system adapted from the Cline Memory Bank methodology.
All AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cline, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) operating in this repository
MUST follow these rules to maintain persistent project context across sessions.

## Memory Bank Location

All memory bank files live in `agentic-memory-bank/` at the project root.

## Memory Bank Structure

Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

  PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
  PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
  PB --> TC[techContext.md]

  PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
  SP --> AC
  TC --> AC

  AC --> P[progress.md]
```

### Core Files (Required)
1. `projectbrief.md` — Foundation document defining core requirements, scope, and goals
2. `productContext.md` — Why the project exists, what problems it solves, UX goals
3. `systemPatterns.md` — Architecture, design patterns, component relationships, critical paths
4. `techContext.md` — Technologies, dev setup, constraints, dependencies, tooling
5. `activeContext.md` — Current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions
6. `progress.md` — What works, what's left, current status, known issues, decision evolution

### Additional Context
Create additional files in `agentic-memory-bank/` when they help organize complex topics:
- Feature specifications
- Integration details
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

## Session Protocol

### At Session Start (MANDATORY)
Every agent session MUST begin by reading ALL memory bank files in dependency order:
1. `projectbrief.md` (foundation)
2. `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md` (context layers)
3. `activeContext.md` (working state)
4. `progress.md` (status)

This is not optional. The memory bank is the only mechanism for understanding project
context after a session reset.

### Plan Mode
When planning work:
1. Read all memory bank files
2. Verify files are complete and current
3. Develop strategy based on documented context
4. Present approach before executing

### Act Mode
When executing work:
1. Check memory bank for current context
2. Execute the task
3. Document changes in relevant memory bank files
4. Update `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`

## When to Update

Memory bank updates MUST occur when:
1. Discovering new project patterns or architectural insights
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When explicitly requested ("update memory bank")
4. When context needs clarification or correction
5. At the end of any substantial work session

When triggered by "update memory bank", the agent MUST review EVERY file, even if some
don't need changes. Focus especially on `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`.

## Update Process

```mermaid

  Start[Update Triggered] --> P1[Review ALL Files]
  P1 --> P2[Document Current State]
  P2 --> P3[Clarify Next Steps]
  P3 --> P4[Record Insights & Patterns]
  P4 --> Done[Update Complete]
```

## Critical Rule

After every session reset, any agent begins completely fresh. The memory bank is its only
link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity — agent effectiveness
depends entirely on its accuracy.
